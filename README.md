# MERN Application

A basic MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that allows users to manage products by category. This project is structured with a backend API and frontend client to demonstrate CRUD operations.

## Features
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- **Frontend**: React with Axios for API requests
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete products and categories

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas for cloud)
- **npm** (or **yarn** for package management)
